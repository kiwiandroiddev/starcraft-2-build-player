"...a must-have tool for serious StarCraft II players"

"So good it should be banned from ladder games."

These are just some of things that top StarCraft 2 players and casters will probably say about SC2 Build Player when they try it. This app turns your Android phone into your own personal StarCraft II coach, giving you visual and audio reminders for buildings, units and upgrades as you play, for your chosen race and strategy.

 • Play like a pro by receiving reminders of complex build orders as you play
 • 50 build orders included in version 2.5.1, including 4 builds for the new Legacy of the Void expansion
 • All build orders include detailed explanation and references - learn the "why" as well as the "what" of effective strategies
 • Includes strategies for every possible match-up of Terran, Zerg and Protoss
 • Uses Text-To-Speech to give you in-game alerts for your build order - no need to look away from your monitor while playing

 • Built-in editor so you can create your own build orders with timings, or customize the standard ones

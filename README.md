Warning to developers
---------------------

If you're looking for the source code of a real-world app to use as a reference for building your own
Android app, you've come to the wrong place.
This was originally released back in 2012 and is the first non-trivial Android app I wrote, using Google's
developer guide and sample apps and a process of trial and error. Its implementation
is tightly coupled to the Android framework and as such is mostly untestable and untested. It has no real
architecture.
